# Fork to Table

### Group Project

## Overview

Have you ever found yourself wondering what to make for dinner? This simple application displays a recipe tracking / meal planning application that allows users to view their favorite recipes and plan shopping trips around them. Users can view a list of recipes, favorite their own recipes, and choose recipes to cook. Our application, "Fork to Table" is a collaborative version of What's Cookin.

## Accessibility

Our group is proud to have a LightHouse score of 100% and to have gained a new perspective after learning about WAI ARIA recently. We hope to continue to make our future applications accessible to all through the code we build.

## Local Set-Up Instructions

- From the repo click the code button and copy the SSH link.
- Open terminal by pressing command + space bar, and search for terminal
- Inside of you terminal type `git clone` and then paste the ssh link. It should look like this: [git@github.com:userigorgithub/whats-cookin.git](git@github.com:userigorgithub/whats-cookin.git)
- In your terminal type `cd whats-cookin`
- Run `NPM install` from your command line: npm install
- Do not run `npm audit fix --force`
- Then type `npm start`
- This will run the Webpack in the terminal so you can view and use the application in your browser
- The browser should then deploy using a local host
- Find the line that says Project is running at: http://localhost:8080/ Copy and paste that URL into your browser into your browser. Now the application set up and ready to use!

- NOTE: Make sure that you type `Control + C` in your terminal when you are done using the application. This ensure the server will stop running before your close your Terminal.

- A user can view a list of all recipes, click on a recipe to view more information including directions, ingredients needed, and total cost.
- A user can filter recipes by a tag or search recipes by their name.
- A user can view what ingredients exist inside of their pantry and check their list of recipes to cook and see if their pantry has enough ingredients to cook a meal.
- A user can add more ingredients to their pantry on their pantry page.

## Technologies Used

- ES6 JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
- Webpack

## Future Features

- Instead of displaying a random user when the app starts, implement a login, or a way to select which user to view
- Implement SCSS and Sass to create a dynamic style on page

## Project management

- We used a [Github Project Board](https://github.com/userigorgithub/whats-cookin/projects/1) stay on task and meet the deadline.
